Growing up I always had an interest in how to create and also to fix things. I was always interested in finding out ways to troubleshoot especially when it came to TV and computers. Many times I wanted to give up but instead, I walked away and came back to it later with a clear mind and Voila! It worked! (most of the time)

It is partly because of my upbringing. My parents faced many struggles in life and they learned how to overcome them by figuring things out and making it work. They were successful. I learned that with patience and love toward each challenge they faced they were able to succeed. This mentality that I have grown with created a passion for me to learn not to quickly dismiss challenges, but to face them and learn how to implement a similar thought process until it was resolved.

Coding poses a similar thought process. With patience and love for coding, the possibilities are endless to what can be created! We will continue to evolve with technology, so why not learn it?  I am so excited to continue learning to code with Flatiron as I know it is how we live now and how we will continue to live in the future. Coding.
